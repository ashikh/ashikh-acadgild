<h1>How Web works</h1>
<p><ins>Documents like images, HTML files are accessed from a remote machine with the help of browser. Browser does the job of connecting to remote machine. Each machine is recognized with unique IP address.</ins></p>
<p><i>It is difficult to remember all IP addresses. Therefore instead of accessing the remote machine via IP address, we access them using a domain name(example:www.acadgild.com)</i>.</p>
<p><strong>The task of converting domain name to IP address is taken care by seperate computers called Name servers. Name servers are a cluster of servers containing domain to IP address mapping.</strong></p> 
<h2>Name server</h2>

<p><i>Servers are machines that provide service to other machines.</i></p>
<p><strong>Clients are machines that request data from them. In this example, the machine that sends request is the client and the machine answering request is the server.</strong></p>
